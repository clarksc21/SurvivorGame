I cannot believe it!
I am so furious right now!
They got me, that's it.
I did the best I could do.
I could've done more.
Dang man, that sucks.
Happy to finally be out.
What a way to go.
I've been bamboozled.
I knew I couldn't trust them.
Liars, all of them.
WHAT!
SMH.
*Crying* I don't wanna go
They ain't getting my vote.
Where did I go wrong?
What didn't I see?
Snakes!
Bout time, I am the biggest threat ever!
I felt this one coming.
I am happy with my experience, wouldn't trade it for the world.
I'll be back...
I wish I had done better.
What are the odds?
Unbelievable.
Inconceivable!
Wild man, wild, wild, wild
They haven't seen the last of me.
Ponderosa is about to meet hell.
Goodluck guys.
Make the best of your opportunities, never trust a snake, they always strike the heel.
Dr. Grimm said something out of pocket again
He witerally hit the gwiddy
What. The. HECK.
*sobs*
Thank goodness I'm out, this was stressful
