Propeller Heads
The castaways would have to go through an obstacle course of digging underneath a log, crossing a balance beam, and under a rope crawl. The castaways would then run across a field to where a spinning series of ten mathematical symbols would be displayed. The castaways would have to memorize the sequence of symbols, run back to starting line through the obstacles, and use the symbols in the correct order to solve a math equation. The first castaway to solve the math problem would win.
Strategy
Blind to Reason
The castaways would race through a maze in the shape of the Survivor logo with their feet shackled together. At the end of the maze, they would build a pole from sticks and rope that was long enough to retrieve a sandbag tied to the end of a rope. They would then swing the sandbag at three targets, with the first person to knock all three over winning the challenge.
Strength and Strategy
Chimney Sweep
The castaways would brace themselves with their arms between two walls while standing barefoot on two foot pegs. Every 15 minutes, the castaways would move down to smaller foot pegs. When the castaways reached the third set of foot pegs, they would try to remain on them as long as they could. The last castaway to remain on their pegs would win.
Balance and Strength
Tarantula
The castaways would have to race through a series of rope tunnels in the shape of a tarantula to three different stations to retrieve three bags of puzzle pieces. The puzzle pieces would then be assembled into a web-shaped puzzle. The first castaway to finish their puzzle would win.
Strategy
Simmotion
The castaways would drop a ball into a metal chute. The ball would travel down a spiraling metal track and exit out of one of two points. The castaway would have to catch the ball and drop the ball back into the chute at the top. Every few minutes, an additional ball would be added to the track until eight balls were simultaneously going around the track. A turnstile gate in the middle of the track would rotate, causing the balls to alternate exiting out of the two exits. If a ball exits the track and is not caught, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge. To make the challenge more difficult, each castaway would have one hand tied behind their backs.
